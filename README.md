# Web Scraping with Python

This repository contains two Python scripts, `main.py` and `extract_links.py`, which demonstrate web scraping using the Beautiful Soup library. The scripts showcase basic techniques for extracting data from HTML documents.

## Requirements

To run the scripts, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.x)
- Beautiful Soup library
- Requests library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

## Usage

### main.py

The `main.py` script showcases various ways to navigate and extract data from an HTML document using Beautiful Soup. It demonstrates accessing elements such as the page title, paragraphs, links, and attributes.

The output will display information about the HTML document, such as the title, element names, element strings, attributes, and selected elements.

### extract_links.py

The `extract_links.py` script demonstrates scraping search results from Google using Beautiful Soup and Requests libraries. It retrieves and displays the headings and corresponding URLs from the search page.

The output will show the headings and URLs of the search results obtained from the first page of the Google search for "Python".
